Description
===========
This repository contains electronic supporting information for the paper
**Discriminating clockwise and counterclockwise photoisomerisation paths
in achiral photoswitches by excited-state electronic circular dichroism**,
submitted by D. Padula.

In this repository, all geometries needed to reproduce my calculations are
provided. More in detail, each folder contains data for a molecule:

- `opt`: this folder contain the optimised geometry at the level of theory
described in the paper.

- `scan`: this folder contains geometries obtained from relaxed scans, at the
level of theory described in the paper.

- `tsh`: this folder contains geometries visited along 100 independent
Trajectory Surface Hopping simulations.

These geometries were used to compute spectroscopic properties at the level of
theory described in the paper.

For further clarifications, please contact me at the email address reported in
the paper.
